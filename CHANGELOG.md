# Changelog

### Version: Exet v0.02 Septeber 14 2020

- Use icons for new blank grid templates.
- Add a "composite anagram" link, but pack it into the anagrams/alternations
  tab. Also generalize the tabs to allow packing more links.
- Add target="\_blank" to all links in about-exet.html (as it is shown in
  an iframe).

### Version: Exet v0.01 Septeber 13 2020

- localStorage might contain junk for a website (as I discovered when I
  hosted on my github site). Need to parse the stored value to check if
  it's an Exet saved revision.

### Version: Exet v0.00 Septeber 13 2020

- First check-in. Exet aims to be a state-of-the-art free open source
  web app for creating crosswords.
